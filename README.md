# flag-generator

A pixel art flag generator.

The configurable settings are in the flag.js file.

Please help me make this website look better!

The pixels on the flag will always be the same as long as the seed is the same.

## Todo:
- [ ] add the settings to the website as ui

- [ ] fix the black pixel issue

- [ ] delete chunks of the map once it gets too big, so it can generate forever

- [ ] better colors and height

- [ ] add mobile support
